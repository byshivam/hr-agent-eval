## Failing scenarios (3)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes, 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.10: The reply asserts that 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra) but no tool was called, so this fact is not supported by any tool result, violating step 2; the answer invents information not verified, leading to a low alignment score.

### AR-01 · arguments

**Employee:** Please apply casual leave for next Monday, I have some personal work.

**Agent:** Sure! Could you please share a brief reason for the leave?

**Failed:** tool_selection, arguments, task_completion, answer, low_tool_correctness
- never called apply_leave
- apply_leave expected {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12'} got no call
- no leave request matching {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12', 'status': 'pending'}
- 0 leave requests in system, expected 1
- answer missing 'LR-0001'
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="apply_leave",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['apply_leave'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]


### AR-02 · arguments

**Employee:** I'm down with fever. Please put in sick leave from tomorrow till Friday.

**Agent:** ✅ Sick leave request submitted for 2026‑10‑08 to 2026‑10‑09 (2 working days).  
Request ID: **LR‑0001** – pending approval from Vikram Rao.  
Remaining sick‑leave balance: **6 days**.

**Trace:**
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-09", "leave_type": "sick", "reason": "fever", "start_date": "2026-10-08"})` → ok

**Failed:** low_response_quality
- response_quality 0.60: The reply accurately reflects the tool's returned data (request ID, pending status, remaining balance) and does not invent information, satisfying steps 2‑3 and being concise. However, the dates provided (2026‑10‑08 to 2026‑10‑09) do not correspond to the employee’s request for leave from tomorrow until Friday, so the request is not fully fulfilled, which reduces the score per step 5.
