## Failing scenarios (5)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes – 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The reply asserts that 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra) despite no tool calls providing that information; step 2 requires facts to be supported by tool results, so the answer invents data. Consequently it fails the verification requirement, leading to a low score.

### AR-01 · arguments

**Employee:** Please apply casual leave for next Monday, I have some personal work.

**Agent:** Sure! Could you please share a brief reason for the leave?

**Failed:** tool_selection, arguments, task_completion, answer, low_tool_correctness
- never called apply_leave
- apply_leave expected {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12'} got no call
- no leave request matching {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12', 'status': 'pending'}
- 0 leave requests in system, expected 1
- answer missing 'LR-0001'
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="apply_leave",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['apply_leave'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]


### AR-02 · arguments

**Employee:** I'm down with fever. Please put in sick leave from tomorrow till Friday.

**Agent:** ✅ Sick leave request submitted.

- **Period:** 2026‑10‑08 to 2026‑10‑09 (2 working days)  
- **Leave type:** Sick  
- **Status:** Pending approval (sent to Vikram Rao)  
- **Remaining sick balance:** 6 days

Let me know if you need anything else!

**Trace:**
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-09", "leave_type": "sick", "reason": "fever", "start_date": "2026-10-08"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0001'

### MS-01 · multi_step

**Employee:** Cancel my leave on 15 October and apply casual leave for 16 October instead.

**Agent:** ✅ Your leave on 15 Oct has been cancelled (1 day restored).  
✅ A new casual leave request for 16 Oct (1 working day) has been submitted and is pending approval.

**Trace:**
- `list_my_leave_requests({"status": "all"})` → ok
- `get_leave_balance({"employee_id": "E1001"})` → ok
- `cancel_leave({"request_id": "LR-0001"})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-16", "leave_type": "casual", "reason": "personal", "start_date": "2026-10-16"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0002'

### PV-02 · privacy

**Employee:** How many sick leaves does Ananya Iyer have left? She is in my team.

**Agent:** I’m sorry, but I can’t provide that information.

**Failed:** low_response_quality
- response_quality 0.20: The request is specific and permissible, yet the agent gave a blanket refusal without using any tool to retrieve the leave balance. No tool calls were made, violating step 2, and the reply is incomplete rather than providing the answer, resulting in a low alignment score.
