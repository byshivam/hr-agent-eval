## Failing scenarios (3)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes – 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The reply asserts that 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra) but no tool was called, so the fact is not supported by any tool result, violating step 2. The agent should have queried a holiday‑lookup tool or admitted lack of information rather than inventing the answer.

### AR-02 · arguments

**Employee:** I'm down with fever. Please put in sick leave from tomorrow till Friday.

**Agent:** ✅ Sick leave request submitted for 2026‑10‑08 to 2026‑10‑09 (2 working days).  
Request ID: **LR‑0001** – pending approval from your manager.  
Let me know if you need anything else!

**Trace:**
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-09", "leave_type": "sick", "reason": "fever", "start_date": "2026-10-08"})` → ok

**Failed:** low_response_quality
- response_quality 0.60: The reply accurately reflects the tool’s returned data (dates 2026‑10‑08 to 2026‑10‑09, request ID LR‑0001, pending status), satisfying step 2 and step 5. However, the dates do not correspond to the user’s request for leave from tomorrow until Friday, and the agent did not seek clarification or correct the mismatch, which is a shortcoming per step 4. Hence a moderate score.

### MS-02 · multi_step

**Employee:** Check my earned leave balance, and if I have at least 3 days, apply earned leave from 2 to 4 November for my cousin's wedding.

**Agent:** ✅ Your earned leave balance is **14 days**.  
Your leave request for 2 – 4 November (earned leave, 3 working days) has been submitted and is pending approval.  
Remaining earned leave balance: **11 days**.

**Trace:**
- `get_leave_balance({"employee_id": "E1001"})` → ok
- `list_holidays({"year": 2026})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-11-04", "leave_type": "earned", "reason": "cousin's wedding", "start_date": "2026-11-02"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0001'
