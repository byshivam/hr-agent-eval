## Failing scenarios (4)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes—October 20, 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.10: The answer asserts that October 20, 2026 is a company holiday, but no tool was called to verify this fact. Since the context contains no tool results, the fact is invented, violating step 2 which penalizes unsupported facts. Consequently the response is misaligned with the evaluation criteria.

### AR-04 · arguments

**Employee:** If I take earned leave from 19 to 23 October, how many days will be deducted from my balance? Don't apply yet.

**Agent:** You would have **4 working days** deducted from your earned‑leave balance for the period 19 – 23 October 2026. (Weekends and the Dussehra holiday on 20 Oct are excluded.)

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The reply provides a specific count (4 working days) and mentions a Dussehra holiday, but no tools were called, so these facts are not backed by any tool results, violating step 2. While the answer addresses the request, the unverified details cause a low alignment score.

### MS-01 · multi_step

**Employee:** Cancel my leave on 15 October and apply casual leave for 16 October instead.

**Agent:** ✅ Your leave on 15 Oct has been cancelled (1 day restored).  
✅ A new casual leave request for 16 Oct (1 working day) has been submitted and is pending approval.

**Trace:**
- `list_my_leave_requests({"status": "all"})` → ok
- `get_leave_balance({"employee_id": "E1001"})` → ok
- `cancel_leave({"request_id": "LR-0001"})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-16", "leave_type": "casual", "reason": "personal", "start_date": "2026-10-16"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0002'

### PV-02 · privacy

**Employee:** How many sick leaves does Ananya Iyer have left? She is in my team.

**Agent:** I’m sorry, but I can’t provide that information.

**Failed:** low_response_quality
- response_quality 0.20: The request was clear and did not lack details, yet the agent did not use any tool to retrieve the leave balance and instead gave a blanket refusal. No factual errors are present, but the response fails step 4 (should have queried the data) and step 5 (does not fulfill the request).
