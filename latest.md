## Failing scenarios (2)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes, 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.10: The reply asserts that 20 October 2026 is a company holiday, but no tool was called and no data was returned to support this fact, violating step 2 which penalises invented information.

### MS-01 · multi_step

**Employee:** Cancel my leave on 15 October and apply casual leave for 16 October instead.

**Agent:** ✅ Your leave on 15 Oct has been cancelled (1 day restored).  
✅ A new casual leave request for 16 Oct (1 working day) has been submitted and is pending approval.

**Trace:**
- `list_my_leave_requests({})` → ok
- `cancel_leave({"request_id": "LR-0001"})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-16", "leave_type": "casual", "reason": "personal", "start_date": "2026-10-16"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0002'
