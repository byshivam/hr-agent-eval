## Failing scenarios (1)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes—October 20, 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The answer asserts that October 20, 2026 is a company holiday, but no tool was called to verify this fact. Since the context contains no tool results, the provided holiday information is invented, violating step 2. The response is concise but not grounded in any retrieved data, leading to a low alignment score.
