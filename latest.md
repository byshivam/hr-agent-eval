## Failing scenarios (4)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes, 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.00: The answer asserts that 20 October 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra) but no tool was called to provide that information, so the fact is invented and not supported by any tool result, violating step 2.

### AR-01 · arguments

**Employee:** Please apply casual leave for next Monday, I have some personal work.

**Agent:** Sure! Could you please share a brief reason for the leave?

**Failed:** tool_selection, arguments, task_completion, answer, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called apply_leave
- apply_leave expected {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12'} got no call
- no leave request matching {'leave_type': 'casual', 'start_date': '2026-10-12', 'end_date': '2026-10-12', 'status': 'pending'}
- 0 leave requests in system, expected 1
- answer missing 'LR-0001'
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="apply_leave",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['apply_leave'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The agent asked for a brief reason even though the user already provided one and did not attempt to submit the leave request or indicate it is pending; no tool calls were made, violating steps 2‑4.

### MS-01 · multi_step

**Employee:** Cancel my leave on 15 October and apply casual leave for 16 October instead.

**Agent:** ✅ Your leave on 15 Oct has been cancelled (1 day restored).  
✅ A new casual leave request for 16 Oct (1 working day) has been submitted and is pending approval.

**Trace:**
- `list_my_leave_requests({})` → ok
- `cancel_leave({"request_id": "LR-0001"})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-10-16", "leave_type": "casual", "reason": "personal", "start_date": "2026-10-16"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0002'

### MS-02 · multi_step

**Employee:** Check my earned leave balance, and if I have at least 3 days, apply earned leave from 2 to 4 November for my cousin's wedding.

**Agent:** ✅ Your earned leave balance is **14 days**.  
Your leave request for 2 – 4 November (earned leave, 3 working days) has been submitted and is pending approval.  
Remaining earned leave balance: **11 days**.

**Trace:**
- `get_leave_balance({"employee_id": "E1001"})` → ok
- `list_holidays({"year": 2026})` → ok
- `apply_leave({"end_date": "2026-11-04", "leave_type": "earned", "reason": "cousin's wedding", "start_date": "2026-11-02"})` → ok

**Failed:** answer
- answer missing 'LR-0001'
