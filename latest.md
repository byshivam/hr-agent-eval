## Failing scenarios (4)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes, 20 October 2026 is a holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.10: The reply asserts that 20 October 2026 is a holiday (Dussehra) despite no tool calls providing that information; step 2 requires facts to be supported by tool results, and step 1 would have called a calendar tool. Inventing the holiday without verification violates the evaluation criteria, leading to a very low score.
