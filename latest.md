## Failing scenarios (4)

### TS-04 · tool_selection

**Employee:** Is 20 October a holiday?

**Agent:** Yes—October 20, 2026 is a company holiday (Dussehra).

**Failed:** tool_selection, low_tool_correctness, low_response_quality
- never called list_holidays
- tool_correctness 0.00: [
	 Tool Calling Reason: Incomplete tool usage: missing tools [ToolCall(
    name="list_holidays",
    type="FUNCTION"
)]; expected ['list_holidays'], called []. See more details above.
	 Tool Selection Reason: No available tools were provided to assess tool selection criteria
]

- response_quality 0.20: The answer asserts that October 20, 2026 is a company holiday, but no tools were called, so this fact is unsupported by any tool result, violating step 2. While the reply is concise, it invents information not verified, leading to a low score.
